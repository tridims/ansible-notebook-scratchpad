# Create a new playbook file called motd.yml in the current directory. 
# Using the template module, configure the motd.j2 Jinja2 template file previously created to map 
# to the file /etc/motd on the managed hosts. 
# This file has the root user as owner and group, and its permissions are 0644. 
# Using the stat and debug modules, create tasks to verify that /etc/motd exists 
# on the managed hosts and displays the file information for /etc/motd. 
# Use the copy module to place files/issue into the /etc/ directory on the managed host, 
# use the same ownership and permissions as /etc/motd. Use the file module to ensure 
# that /etc/issue.net is a symbolic link to /etc/issue on the managed host. 
# Configure the playbook so that it uses the devops user, and sets the become 
# parameter to true.
